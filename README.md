# Monster-Chase-Game
It's a simple platformer game i made while learning about unity.

Hey 
This is one of my learning project i made with help of tutorials from freecodecamp. 
It's a simple platformer game where you have to avoid ememies by jumping over them.
It lack a bit of exciting challenging part right now, maybe i will fix it in future while practicing more.
That's it.
Thanks for reading :)
