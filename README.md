# Monster Chase Game

Welcome to the **Monster Chase Game**! This is a simple platformer game that I created while learning about Unity. In this game, your objective is to navigate through the levels while avoiding enemies by jumping over them.

## Gameplay

The gameplay is straightforward:

- **Controls**: Use the arrow keys (or WASD) to move your character. Press the spacebar to make your character jump.

- **Objective**: Your main goal is to reach the end of each level without getting caught by the enemies. If you collide with an enemy, you'll lose a life and respawn at the beginning of the current level.

## Getting Started

To play the game locally, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Unity installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the [Unity website](https://unity.com/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Skofficial2007/Monster-Chase-Game.git
   ```

3. **Open in Unity**: Open Unity Hub and click on the "Add" button. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and select the project folder to open the game in Unity.

4. **Play the Game**: Once the project is open in Unity, locate the main scene file (e.g., `MainScene.unity`) in the project hierarchy. Double-click to open it. You can now click the play button to start the game and test it out.

## Future Improvements

This project is one of my learning experiences with Unity, and I acknowledge that there's room for improvement:

- **Challenging Gameplay**: As of now, the game might lack a bit of excitement and challenge. I plan to refine the level design, add more obstacles, and possibly introduce power-ups to enhance the overall experience.

- **Visual Enhancements**: I intend to improve the game's visual aspects by adding better graphics, animations, and effects.

- **Bug Fixes**: If you encounter any bugs or issues while playing the game, please feel free to open an issue in this repository. Your feedback will help me refine the game.
